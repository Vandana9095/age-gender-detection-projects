# Fine-Tune Age Detection Model

This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model (such as VGGFace) for age detection. The IMDB-WIKI dataset is recommended, but for lightweight experiments and faster training, the UTKFace dataset was used.

---

## 💡 Key Features:
- Fine-tunes a pre-trained CNN using transfer learning.
- Predicts human age from facial images.
- Suitable for both custom datasets and UTKFace.
- No GUI required.
